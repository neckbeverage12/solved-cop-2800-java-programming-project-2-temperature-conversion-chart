Using <a href="https://wpollock.com/lister.php?file=Java/GUIGreet.java&amp;nodir&amp;dl&amp;linenums">GUIGreet.java</a> as a model, create a Java stand-alone <abbr>GUI</abbr> program that displays a Fahrenheit to Celsius temperature conversion table in an <abbr>AWT</abbr> <code>Frame</code> or a swing <code>JFrame</code>.  The table should run from 0 degrees Fahrenheit to 250 degrees Fahrenheit, in steps of 10 degrees.  Round the Celsius temperature values to the nearest integer.

Display any temperatures below the freezing point of water (32<sup><small>o</small></sup> Fahrenheit) in blue and any temperatures above the boiling point of water (212<sup><small>o</small></sup> Fahrenheit) in red (the rest in black).

The formula to use is:

See <a href="https://wpollock.com/Java/TempConv/TempConv.jar">TempConv.jar</a> model solution for a sample chart; just download and double-click to run.

Degrees Celsius = ( 5 ÷ 9 ) × ( Degrees Fahrenheit – 32 Degrees )

<h2>Other Requirements:</h2>

You must turn in a stand-alone <abbr>AWT</abbr> or swing program, not an <code>Applet</code> or <code>JApplet</code> nor a JavaFx program.  You must meet all the requirements from the description above.  If you include any creative extras, be sure your program still performs the basic chart as described above.  Creative extras are <em>extras</em>, and you are not free to modify the project requirements.

It is <span class="highlight">not acceptable</span> to pre-compute each Celsius value, and just have many “<code>g.drawString()</code>” statements.  You need to use Java to calculate each value using the correct formula, and use various control structures.

A non-working project can score quite well (so don’t be afraid to turn one in).  Also a fully working project may not score 100%.

You must work alone on your project, however you can ask your instructor for help anytime.  Please see the syllabus for additional information about projects.
